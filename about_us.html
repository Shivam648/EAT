            <p>An explanatory paragraph is a paragraph that explains an idea and informs the reader. For example if an essay is cause and effect or the comparison and contrasting of ideas.
                For cause and effect - that involves an action that causes something to occur and the result of that action. What events happen to create other events. Think about a character
                 in a story and what propels that character to take the path s/he does.</p>
